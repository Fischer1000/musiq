# Things to be done

1. Adding the ability to select all minutes of a day at break time selection.
2. Having a global variable in which the state of the currently playing song is stored if any.
3. Adding nameday announcements.
4. Having authorization on the webpage in the form of an API key.
5. Storing and sending the web UI's resources compressed via gzip.  

# Bugs to be fixed
1. Restricting new song playing from the web UI to only start when nothing is playing.
